    <h2>Magic Eye Images aka Autostereogram</h2>
    <h4>An autostereogram is a single-image stereogram (SIS), designed to create the visual illusion of a three-dimensional (3D) scene from a two-dimensional image.</h4>
    <h3>How to View Stereograms</h3>
    <p>Pre-requisite: 2 seeing eyes, if you can only see from one eye this will not be possible</p>


    <p>1. Put your face close to the screen or printed stereogram. Try to look through the image, pretending it doesn't exist. Of course you won't be able to see anything yet because image is too close to the eyes.<br><br>

    2. Always hold stereogram horizontally, do not turn and do not bend it. Don't tilt your head and try not to blink.<br><br>

    3. Then start to move back from the stereogram (or move stereogram away from you) very slowly. Your eyes naturally will try to refocus back on the image but you will need to force your eyes not to do so. Keep looking through the image and moving back from it slowly at the same time. If it happens that eyes focus on the image start Step 1 again.<br><br>

    4. Once you can keep looking through the stereogram, keep moving it (or your head) back and force very slowly. At some distance, when <strong>patterns</strong> overlap each other, you will notice that something strange is happening to the image. That's a very good sign and after a while you will see blurry levels of depth or some 3D images.<br><br>
        
    5. Once you can see blurry 3D picture, keep looking at it this way. Don't force your eyes to focus yet, they will need some time to adjust. After a few seconds or minutes you'll see how image snaps and becomes very sharp. When it happens you will know that you can see the stereogram.<br><br>
